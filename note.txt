we serve one fallback page for each request which is not in the cache when there's no connection and that is a problem because what if I'm offline and requesting some kind of image from one of the pages that is not cached then we're going to replace it with the fallback.html page and that makes no senses for images or other types of resources like CSS only for HTML pages and actual website routes, so we need to check before return this fallback.html page.
