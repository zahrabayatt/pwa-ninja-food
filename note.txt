right now when we visit pages and resources online, we're caching every new dynamic page or resource that we come across that's not already cached, but it means at some point that our cache is going to become bloated and be a drain on resources because we're just caching everything that we request, now it would be nice to be able to limit our different caches to a specific size, so that they could only hold X number of items and when that number of items is reached then we can remove oldest item and so forth.
