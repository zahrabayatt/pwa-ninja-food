To display this pwa inside android emulator, we open up a browser in android emulator and go to this address:
http://10.0.2.2:portnumber

fo this application we head over to http://10.0.2.2:5500

10.0.2.2:
this is a specific address which is going to be act as a proxy to localhost in our machine

this 10.0.2.2 only work for index.html that open using live server, for preview a website that built using vite and react we need to Configure Vite for Network Access:

1- Open vite.config.js (or create it if you don't have one) and add the following configuration:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0', // This allows network devices to access the server
    port: 5173,      // Ensure this matches the port you're running on
  },
});

** If you want to keep this configuration but only apply it in development, you can conditionally include it like this:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig(({ command }) => ({
  plugins: [react()],
  ...(command === 'serve' && {
    server: {
      host: '0.0.0.0',
      port: 5173,
    },
  }),
}));

2- In the Android emulator, open Chrome and try something like this for zahrabayatt/to-do-app repository http://10.0.2.2:5173/to-do-app/
