in the offline mode, because we only cache the app shell, if user goes to a page like about or contact, we see the default message of browser that says connection is lost. so right now we don't actually have that much of an offline experience. all a user can do is sit there and stare at the home page and twiddle the thumbs and that's not very good, so how about instead we start to cache all the pages as well, so if the user goes offline at some point then they can browser around the site and they can go different pages because we've cached those? 
we don't want to cache these in the same cache as we did so far (static-cache) because if user is offline might not go to different pages and all these cache assets are unnecessary and we're wasting resources doing that. 
the better approach would be to wait until the user is online and while the user is online typically what they do is they browser around the site and at that point what we should do is wait for that request form the browser to get that page comes back and when we get that response form the server at that point, we cache that and we'll cache it in different cache that static cache because we're keeping our app shell assets separate then from any other dynamic assets.
where we are going to dynamic caches?
